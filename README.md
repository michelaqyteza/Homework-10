 ## Team Profile Generator 
I have built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, that generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I have written a unit test for every part of my code to ensure that it passes each test. 

## Technologies used 
In this project Node.js, Node Package Manager, JS, and Bootstrap have been used in this generator. 

## How do i use it? 
Here is a demonstration of how to use my Profile Generator using your command-line. To see the tutorial on my youtube Click

## Screenshots 
Every ones webpage will look differently depending on who is on your team and how many engineers and interns you have. In my page I made it so all of your engineers are in one column and all your interns are in another column.  Your page will look similar to the screenshots below.
